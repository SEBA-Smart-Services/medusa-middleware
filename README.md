# Medusa Middleware
A lightweight middleware service for StruxureWare Building Operation.

Medusa Middleware is a helper middleware web service for requesting and transforming data from unsupported protocols and data formats (eg HTTP JSON, SNMP trap) into an easily consumable XML web service for StruxureWare Building Operation. Medusa Middleware can be used to allow StruxureWare Building Operation and SmartStruxure Servers to consume (and eventually serve) data from 3rd party services, both on-premise and cloud based.
